Thank you for participating in correcting the text extracted from scanned Sacred Harp minutes books. Your work will help grant future singers and researchers to Sacred Harp’s history, preserved in these records thanks to the work of thousands of secretaries over decades. 

## Objective
Your primary goal is to _make the text of the page from the minutes book you are working with match the text in the corresponding image of the page_. This means that whenever you spot a difference between the two you should update the text to match the original. 

The differences you will encounter are the result of problems with the process of optical character recognition (OCR), in which a computer program attempts to identify the text in a digitized page image. Errors in OCR could include substitutions of similar-looking letters, strange punctuation or special characters in place of more standard ones, or even whole garbled words or sets of words. Errors in OCR may also include “overcorrections,” where misspelled words in the original are spelled correctly in the recognized text.

In just about every case, you should try to correct these discrepancies. This means correcting any substitutions or garbled words, restoring missing words, and even uncorrecting errors that appear in the original image but not the recognized text.

You should make two other changes before finishing your work on the page:
1.	_Delete header and footer information_ so that all the text that remains is associated with the minutes.
2.	If the page you are working on includes the end of minutes from one singing and the beginning of minutes for the next singing, create a blank line between the two sets of minutes and _insert the character string `%%%%` between the two singings' minutes_. This will help with the automatic detection of where one singing ends and the next begins.

## Frequently Asked Questions
Q: If the original image has a misspelled name should I correct that in the text? 

A: No. Since your goal is for the text to match the image, you should ensure that the name is spelled exactly as it is in the original.

Q: If it looks like there were two or three or more spaces between two words in the original image but only one appears in the text I am editing, should I add additional spaces?

A: As long as the text features one or more spaces between the two words you do not have to worry about matching the original. If there are no spaces between two words in the original, you should ensure that there is no space in the text either.

Q: Should I try to match line breaks to the original image? Should I remove the hyphens or line breaks between words separated by a line break?

A: Leave the line breaks as they appear in the original. Likewise, leave the hyphens in place, even if they break up a singer’s name.

Q: What if I can't read a letter in the original?

Q: What if a page number is wrong in the original because it doesn't match a song in _The Sacred Harp_?

Q: What if I know a name is wrong in the original because I know the person or how they spell their name?

Q: What if there is unusual formatting in the original that can't be represented in the recognized text?
